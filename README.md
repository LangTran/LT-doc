# LangTran Software Distribution System
## Documentation
Documentation files for the LangTran software distribution system

The files here are the sources of the PDF files that are distributed to users. They are .fodt files so changes can be tracked as they are edited in Libre Office. Another advantage of editing them with Libre Office is that the links are exported properly to the PDF files.

You should read these files in numerical order, branching to match the decisions about the kind of connection to the LangTran server that you decide to use.

The overall description of LangTran is [here](http://lingtransoft.info/apps/langtran).
